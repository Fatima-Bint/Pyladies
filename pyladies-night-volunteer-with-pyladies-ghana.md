# Pyladies Night - Volunteer with PyLadies Ghana

The community's first PyLadies night for 2023 was hosted on Twitter Space with an engaging panel discussion on the theme "Volunteer with PyLadies Ghana; Empower Your Network, Empower Your Career." The panel featured three of our PyLadies as speakers: Yaa Nuamah, Abigail Afi Maame, and Theresa Seyram. We'll be delving into the key takeaways and valuable insights shared during this enlightening discussion.

### Overview of the Panel Discussion:&#x20;

The panel discussion revolved around the empowering potential of volunteering with PyLadies Ghana and other tech communities. It explored how volunteering can positively impact one's professional development, personal network, and attitude when volunteering. The panelists shared their personal experiences with volunteering and expertise, shedding light on the transformative power of volunteering in the tech community.

As we all know, volunteering (paid or free) is like an extra-curricular activity outside of our regular job, we looked at some of the benefits and red flags to look out for when volunteering.

Yaa mentioned that you can't outrightly see the red flags in a community when applying as a volunteer but it would help to take note of some of these red flags as shared by the panelists.
