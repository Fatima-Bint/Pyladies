# PyLadies Night With Cheuk Ting Ho

On Saturday, July 29, Pyladies Ghana had another insightful session of our monthly Pyladies Night series where we hosted the excellent Cheuk Ting Ho to share her expertise on “How to set up your talk or tutorial proposal for a Python conference”.

Cheuk is an avid open-source contributor and organizer of PyData London and Humble Data community events. She’s also a PSF Director and fellow and an advocate for Open-source software (OSS) Security.

She started out as a data scientist, learned about conferences, joined a supportive community, and took the chance to submit her first proposal, which was rejected.

She went ahead to submit another one at another conference, and it was accepted, and she kept at it until she switched careers to developer relations (DevRel) to start giving talks full-time.&#x20;

#### Why should I speak publicly?

Cheuk divided the reasons why a person might be interested in speaking publicly into two categories:

Personal Gain: Some of which include:

1. Showing and sharing one’s knowledge, especially with potential future employers.
2. Build credibility.
3. Being able to voice opinions on specific topics
4. Build a career out of it for example DelRel roles.

and Community Gain

#### How exactly do I start?

Find a safe environment. It might be any of the following:

* Local meetups with supportive audiences
* Internal events at the workplace (if it is a supportive environment)
* Communities that support inclusion and diversity
* Events that have an effective Code of Conduct (CoC)
* Look for online events that accept recorded talks

Mentorship

* Join a Mentorship program (e.g. EuroPython)
* Ask a colleague or friend to help guide and rehearse your talk.
* Ask in a supportive community

It is highly recommended to start your public speaking journey with a lightning talk(5-10 (5–10 minutes). Look out for recorded or live talks in order not to get overwhelmed by having to give a physical talk, and finally, **Do Not do Live Demos**.

#### Tips to look out for when submitting a proposal&#x20;

* Do it before the deadline
* Talk about something that you care about
* A use case at work may be a good start
* Avoid sales pitches
* Deliver the educational value of the talk (why should people attend your talk)
* State that you identify as a minority in tech

And remember, it is totally okay and common to have your proposal rejected. Don’t give up; try again. Perhaps you can make a career out of it.
